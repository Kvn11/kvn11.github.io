Hello! My name is Kevin Romero and I am a student at the University of Connecticut currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering with a concentration in cybersecurity. As a result, I have made this site to document the different challenges that I solve over the course of my studies. This site is based off the [jekyll-shell-theme](https://github.com/tareqdandachi/jekyll-shell-theme).
